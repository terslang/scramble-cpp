* Scramble

Scramble is a c++ header only library which prints a collection of strings in a scrambled manner with random characters.
Inspired from this awesome [[https://codepen.io/soulwire/pen/mEMPrK][awesome codepen example]].

** How to use it?

Since this is a header only library add the header file directly in your source code or include directory and use it in your program as shown below.

#+BEGIN_SRC c++
#include "scramble-cpp/scramble.hpp"
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::vector<std::string> texts = {"Neo,",
                                      "sooner or later",
                                      "you're going to realize",
                                      "just as I did",
                                      "that there's a difference",
                                      "between knowing the path",
                                      "and walking the path"};
    Scramble::scramble(texts, false); // changing it to true here will clear the text after printig is done
    std::cout << "\n";
    return 0;
}
#+END_SRC
